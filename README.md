Lab 2: 
Assignment 2
SUBMIT original code in Python to solve the problem below.  
Please be aware that copying and pasting code from any other source other than code you have explicitly written on your own is considered plagiarism.  If you receive help, that is fine (document help in the comments of your code) however you need to write your own code, name your own variables, and comment your own code. Students turning in the exact same work as another student will all be given zeros. Plagiarism is not tolerated, and students found to be plagiarizing will be given a zero and reported to the University with the possibility of termination of the class and degree program.
For this assignment you will be provided with a file containing the input data to the program. Write a python program that calculates the final averages for a group of students and print the results in descending order by grade. For each student in the provided input file your program should calculate the student’s final average and then print the student’s name and final average in descending order by grade. 

The format of the input file will be one student per line. The first field will be the student’s name followed by 6 fields containing scores to be averaged. Each field is separated by a single space.

Example Input
	Bob 100 34 25 22 76 87
Jack 43 54 99 63 101 44
Jane 78 98 45 74 65 23

Example Output
	Jack 67.33
	Jane 63.83
Bob 57.33
